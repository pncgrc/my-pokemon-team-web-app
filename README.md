# Welcome to my project repo!
This is the final result of my Web Development 2024 project at AP University College, Graduate Program in Programming – 1st year

## If you don't feel like registering, you can use the standard account:
username: user
password: user

### Cool things to check out:
- Resize your browser window or visit the app on your smartphone! Support for smaller screens has been implemented.
- Every user that’s created automatically gets the “user” role. You can view the app as an admin by logging in with the username **admin** — and guess what the password is... :)
- Try visiting a page that doesn’t exist ([Example 1](https://project-webdev-ponci.onrender.com/pokemon/oisgjk) or [Example 2](https://project-webdev-ponci.onrender.com/oisgjk))
- Enter a wrong password or forget to fill in a required field when updating a Pokémon (and watch the bottom of your screen).
